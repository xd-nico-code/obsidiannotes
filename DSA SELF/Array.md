An array is a data structure which can be defined as finite ordered set of homogeneous elements
- finite (set number of elements)
- ordered (the elements are fixed at a index)
- homogeneous (all elements are of same type)
- contiguous memory (each element is stored as the very next address )
- Random access (no need to iter through elements to access a )
